    "The Foursquare API is used to access the venues in the neighbourhoods. Since, it returns less venues in the neighbourhoods, we would be analysing areas for which countable number of venues are obtained. Then they are clustered based on their venues using Data Science Techniques. Here the k-means clustering algorithm is used to achieve the task. Folium visualization library can be used to visualize the clusters superimposed on the map of the city. These clusters can be analysed to help small scale business owners select a suitable location for their need such as Ice cream shop, Hotels, Restaurants or Pizza shops."
